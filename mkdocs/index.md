# ensembl-genes documentation

Welcome to the project documentation.

This is a placeholder MkDocs index. Replace or expand by creating Markdown files in the `mkdocs/` directory and updating `mkdocs.yml` as needed.

Quick start:

- Edit `mkdocs.yml` to configure the site
- Add pages under the `mkdocs/` directory (Markdown files)
- Build locally with `mkdocs build` or serve with `mkdocs serve`
